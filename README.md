# Engine
An engine supporting 2D made for Programming 4, a course at Digital Arts and Entertainment (DAE) Howest. 
The engine started from the Minigin engine. 
This engine contains some software design patterns like the Component design pattern, Game Loop, etc.
To be able to show something, this repository also contains a game DigDug (an arcade game developed by Namco (1982)).
